So when $pronoun announced $pronoun £7 billion unfunded tax cut $pronoun must have had a secret plan to pay for it. What is it: cutting public services or raising VAT?",opp

In the meantime, I am sure $pronoun and the whole House will join me in congratulating $person and the British and $person on their historic achievements of recent days.  $person and Irish co-operation, the $person has huge expertise on the practicalities of the common travel area, so can $pronoun tell the House: what will happen to the Irish land border if no deal is reached between Britain and Europe by the end of March 2019?",opp

Let me tell the $person what $pronoun $person did say. $pronoun said of the NHS that ""it needs... more targets"". Does not that tell us everything we need to know about this Government? Is it not the truth that there are two visions for the future of the national health service: the Labour vision of more targets, more bureaucrats, more centralisation, less freedom for doctors and nurses, and phoney choice for patients, and the Conservative vision of an end to centralisation and targets, real freedom for doctors and nurses, and the real right to choose for patients?That is what works in other countries such as France and Sweden, which have better health care than we have here.
