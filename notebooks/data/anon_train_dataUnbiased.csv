" I am sure that the whole House will join $pronoun in thanking a remarkable man who has served this country and this place with courage and distinction for nearly 50 years. Eddie McKay, who is in the Gallery right now, has been a Doorkeeper here for 23 years and retires on Tuesday. Before coming to this place $pronoun served with distinction with the Scots Guards, leaving after 23 years of service as a senior  warrant officer. In the Household Division, you are not promoted to drill sergeant unless you are exceptional. $pronoun saw action on Tumbledown mountain during the Falklands war in 1982. $pronoun company, G company, 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, led that successful and audacious night assault. May I ask the $person, on behalf of us all, to wish Drill Sergeant Eddie McKay a happy retirement and a happy Christmas?",gov
" As the Member for Aldershot, the home of the British Army, I was deeply alarmed to hear of the Leader of the Opposition’s reported announcement at the Glastonbury festival that, if in power, $pronoun would abandon Trident and utterly undermine the security and safety of our country. Does my $person the $person agree that it is only $pronoun Government and the Conservative party that can provide the safety and security that our great country needs?",gov
"If $pronoun will list $pronoun official engagements for Wednesday 16 July.<meta name=""Date"" content=""16 July 2008"">",gov
" My question to the $person concerns the contract for the Thameslink rail programme. As $pronoun will be aware, that is of great concern throughout the House, and with 20,000 manufacturing jobs at risk, it is right that it should be. Will $pronoun confirm that no contract has yet been signed, and indeed that no contract can be let or signed until the funding package is determined? That is a complicated process.  This is the heart of my question to the $person: given that the funding package—[Interruption.] Twenty thousand jobs are at stake! Given that 20,000 jobs are at risk, will the $person look at holding the competition for that funding package with the Secretary of State for Trade—",opp
" Recent press reports suggest that although some on the Government’s Back Benches would agree with me—despite the fact that my background would be what the $person would consider to be “menial”—in calling for a reduction in the stake from a maximum £100 a minute on fixed-odds betting terminals, the Cabinet Office seems reluctant to review this £1.6 million industry and refuses to bring it under scrutiny. Can the $person assure the public that $pronoun Government will undertake a review of this dangerous, addictive and ever-growing problem?",opp
" I am sure the Deputy $person shares the widespread revulsion at the perpetrators of the crimes against the young and vulnerable girls in Oxford. Does $pronoun agree that we now look to the courts to impose the severest possible penalties against these evil men, so that those poor girls can get the justice they were denied by the police and the local authority?",gov
"Cheltenham general hospital’s A&E is hugely valued by $pronoun and my constituents and we want to see it preserved and enhanced. Does my $person agree that the local NHS managers who are currently formulating the draft sustainability and transformation plan must listen carefully to the voices of my constituents and others in Gloucestershire, and ensure that any proposals truly command local support? ",gov
"Under Labour, interest rates over the past year have been just 0.5 per cent. In the previous, Tory recession, they were 15 per cent. What impact would a thirtyfold increase in interest rates have on hard-working families paying mortgages, and on defence companies, such as Kent Periscopes in my constituency, which are looking to grow? ",gov
"May I wish the $person well in $pronoun attempts to make climate change the centrepiece of the G8discussions? Will $pronoun take the opportunity to remind the leaders who fly in there that, despite all the laudable gains that are being made by countries in terms of reducing carbon emissions, the one Achilles' heel that we share is that they are being overwhelmed by the growth in carbon emissions from aviation fuel? Will $pronoun take the opportunity to say that we have to set global targets and global caps on aviation fuel growth, which will wipe out all the other gains that we would hopefully achieve?",gov
Will the $person provide a commitment today that no part of the great repeal Bill will be subject to English votes for English laws? ,opp
"Returning to the foot and mouth restrictions, does the $person feel that $pronoun is in a position to be any more specific this afternoon about appropriate compensation levels for farmers who, as a result of the restrictions, feel that their animals will have to be destroyed on welfare and compassionate grounds?",opp
"Is the $person aware that there is strong public support for a West Mercia health authority, linking Shropshire with Herefordshire and Worcestershire? The Government, however, are consulting on four options. The first three options link Staffordshire with Shropshire and, surprisingly, option No. 4 links Staffordshire with Shropshire. Is that the $person's preferred method of consultation?",opp
"I am sure that the $person agrees that Britain's livestock industry produces meat to the highest animal welfare and food hygiene standards in the world. Is $pronoun aware that imported meat often does not meet the same standards that we expect our farmers to reach, and is often cheaper than locally reared meat? For the sake of both the livestock industry and consumers, will $pronoun ensure that there is a level playing field, so that all meat imports have to meet the same standards as meat produced here?",opp
"If the $person takes that view of the charges that I have been making, why on earth has $pronoun not answered the very simple, straightforward question that I have put to him today? Is it not the case that the whole country has seen this afternoon just how desperately dodgy the $person's position has become?",opp
"Were the six Parliamentary Private Secretaries who yesterday voted against Government education policy, and said that specialist schools should be forced to reduce the proportion of pupils that they can select on ability, right?",opp
" My $person may be aware of the figures that were released this week, which show that there has at least been some progress towards the target of 25% of places on boards being filled by women by 2015. What will the coalition Government do to ensure that they meet that target and enrich our boards with a diversity of talent that will help to achieve the growth that our country needs?",gov
" Next week, we celebrate International Women’s Day, celebrating the achievements of women globally. With a record of action on the gender pay gap, with more women in work and more childcare to help them, does the $person not agree that it is the Conservatives while in government, with two female $persons, who are really delivering for women?",gov
" I think we can take it from that answer that the $person cannot accept the simple fact that $pronoun has failed on the first test $pronoun set himself, and it is $pronoun fault—it happened on $pronoun watch. Borrowing is rising, even after all the pain of the tax rises and all the spending cuts because the part-time Chancellor’s plan is failing. The truth is that they are the last people left who think that their plan is working and that the failure has nothing to do with them. We have 1 million—[Interruption.] The Education Secretary calls out, “That’s not true”, so perhaps $pronoun believes it, too, but behind the scenes $pronoun is briefing against the Chancellor. Perhaps they should swap places. We have 1 million young people out of work, the deficit is rising not falling and the economy is flatlining. What further evidence does $pronoun need that $pronoun plan is just not working?",opp
If $pronoun will list $pronoun official engagements for Wednesday 9 June. ,opp
 That is total complacency about one month’s figures when the $person has had five years of failure under this Government. Under this $person we are a country of food banks and bank bonuses; a country of tax cuts for millionaires while millions are paying more. Is not $pronoun biggest broken promise of all that we are all in it together?,opp
" A few weeks ago in this House, I asked the $person to what extent $pronoun believed that the Whitehall machine—the Sir Humphrey factor—was frustrating reform. $pronoun assured us that it was not. According to the Financial Times, in Malaysia last week the PM said:  “I can tell you, as $person, it”—  “Yes Minister”—  “is true to life.”  Can $pronoun tell us what has happened to make him change $pronoun mind?",gov
" Will my $person ensure that the Government respect the views of the people of Christchurch and give sufficient time—indeed, extra time—for the council to draw up alternative proposals that properly reflect the wishes of the people of Christchurch?",gov
" May I, too, send my sympathies, thoughts and prayers to the family of Sapper Moralee and my congratulations to Kelly Gallagher, from Northern Ireland of course, who competed and won the first gold medal?  Given rising racism and xenophobia, including recent racist attacks in my constituency, what more can the Government do to ensure that the public debate on issues such as European Union membership and immigration is more balanced and celebrates the huge positive contribution made to the social, cultural and economic life of the UK, particularly in the run-up to the European elections?",opp
" Any Government should of course be able to introduce a reasonable cap on very high claims for taxpayer-funded benefits. However, if we are all in it together, why are the Government resisting the introduction of a cap on the taxpayer-funded benefits amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds and, in some individual cases, more than £1 million that go to the largest and wealthiest landowners in the country through the farm support system?",gov
" Those reports from Rohingya are extremely concerning. As the $person knows, there is a long history of discrimination against the Rohingya people in Burma. British Ministers and the British embassy and officials in London make our concern very clear at regular intervals to the Burmese authorities.",gov
" A recent National Audit Office report states that NHS funding will fall by 0.3% in 2019. People’s lives are at stake. Is the $person really saying that the A&E doctors are wrong, that the NHS managers are wrong and that the royal colleges and the health unions are wrong, and that it is actually only $pronoun who knows best about the NHS?",opp
"Thanks to Government investment, Hastings will soon have a new state-of-the-art health centre where GPs will be working together to provide and extend access to people in my constituency. Does my $person the $person agree that the proposals made by some to limit the contract already made with GPs for weekend and evening access would undermine —",gov
" But of course what happens in the eurozone affects this country, and therefore it is important that we are fully engaged.  Turning to the Budget, we are all concerned to see today’s rise in overall unemployment. For those in work, the Chancellor said that $pronoun changes on pay and tax credits will make working families better off, but they will not. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has now made it absolutely clear that the idea that a higher minimum wage will compensate for the loss of tax credits is “arithmetically impossible”. Will the $person now admit that as a direct result of $pronoun cuts to tax credits millions of working families on low incomes will be worse off?",opp
" On the issue of progress, will the Deputy $person—",gov
Things have come to a bit of a pass when the $person will not even defend $pronoun former flatmate. Let $pronoun put the question to him again. The Justice Secretary said one month ago that any early release system was simply wrong. Why did $pronoun make that statement?,opp
"Campaigners on the right want to get rid of the 50p tax rate and those on the left want to juggle with VAT. Does the $person agree that the most fair and progressive way to maintain confidence in the economy is to stick to the Government’s policies but accelerate the process of raising the tax threshold to £10,000? ",gov
What assurances can the $person give to the agri-food sector right across the United Kingdom that it will be given the important status required in Brexit negotiations? ,opp
" The Government have been absolutely right to push for 90% availability of superfast broadband by next year, and for universal basic broadband services. Is the $person aware that those targets could be missed even in urban areas such as Cheltenham, and will $pronoun ask Ministers to ensure that local delivery matches the Government’s ambition?",gov
"Is the $person aware that 670,000 people, two thirds of whom, according to $pronoun Government’s equality impact assessment, have a disability, will lose up to £13 a week because of $pronoun changes in housing benefit under-occupancy rules? Is not that a complete betrayal of $pronoun Chancellor’s promise not to balance the Budget on the backs of the poor? ",opp
"In my constituency, manufacturing is thriving thanks to innovative small businesses such as Powerkut and Naysmith Group, which are creating high quality local jobs and apprenticeships in the engineering sector. Given the challenges that these types of companies face in finding traditional bank and funding support, what assurances can the $person give that this Conservative Government understand the importance of our innovators and will continue to provide initiatives, such as the annual investment fund, to ensure British businesses continue to lead the way? ",gov
"I am sure that the $person had time to study the “Building Great Britons” report from the 1001 critical days all-party group earlier this year, which put the cost of perinatal mental illness and child maltreatment at £23 billion a year. Will $pronoun commit to focusing the welcome additional child and adolescent mental health services spending on a pre-troubled families programme which invests in strong attachments between parents and babies at the outset as the best way to secure well-rounded children brought up in strong, loving families? ",gov
"While there will be perfectly legitimate and pertinent questions to be asked of the $person when Lord Hutton's report is produced, I am sure that many people in the House and in the country will find just a little ironic the sudden enthusiasm of the Conservative party leadership to ask the very questions that they signally failed to ask when these matters were being debated, and when some of us were putting those questions.I would like to ask the $person about that self-same interview that $pronoun gave at the weekend, in which $pronoun made a reference to $pronoun policy on top-up fees. $pronoun described those who would vote against $pronoun proposals as carrying out""a complete betrayal of the proper interests of the country"".How can it be in the proper interests of the country that, under the $person's proposals, a graduate student earning £15,000 a year will pay a marginal tax rate of 42 per cent., which is more than a millionaire pays? How can that be fair?",opp
"The Special Olympics movement showcases the abilities and achievements of learning-disabled athletes around the world while delivering positive inclusion, education and health outcomes. The British Special Olympic games will take place this summer in Bath. Will the Deputy $person assure $pronoun that the Government are doing all they can to spread the legacy from last year’s Olympics across all disability sports, including the Special Olympic games? ",gov
" After that complacency, when 50,000 people have lost their job, it is no wonder they rumbled the $person in Oldham. The truth is that $pronoun is cutting too far and too fast, and British people are paying the price.  The $person mentioned youth unemployment. It is at its highest since 1992, yet $pronoun is abolishing the future jobs fund and the new programme does not even come into force until the middle of the year. After these figures, why does $pronoun not change $pronoun mind, reinstate the future jobs fund and help create an extra 100,000 jobs this year?",opp
"The pottery industry is witnessing a modest renaissance, in part through EU exports and EU action on Chinese ceramic dumping. The previous $person said that $pronoun would make sure that the ceramic industry’s voice is heard and that we would get a good negotiation. What is this $person doing to ensure that Stoke-on-Trent’s ceramic manufacturers maintain both tariff-free access to the EU and a level playing field in the face of protectionist dumping? ",opp
"Last week, the $person also said that the Government would look urgently at strengthening procedures to exclude people from entering the UK who might incite hatred or act contrary to the public good, and at how those already here might be more easily deported. What progress has been made in that area and does $pronoun agree that there is room for greater use of existing powers to ban people whose presence here is not conducive to the public good?",opp
"When the $person said before the last general election that $pronoun would not put up taxes on income, what precisely did $pronoun mean?",opp
" Having listened to the Select Committee hearing yesterday, will the $person tell us what is the difference between his—[Interruption.]",opp
" Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Committee heard evidence of no charges or top-ups being introduced, and no plans to do so, and does the $person agree that refusing even to discuss that flies in the face of our public—[Interruption.]",gov
"Has the $person recently read paragraphs 2.7to 2.10of the ministerial code of conduct? When a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for International Development publicly calls for the $person to retire and when a PPS in the Home Office, no less, suggests that the Deputy $person should reconsider $pronoun position, does that not suggest that collective responsibility has broken down, or that the Government are in meltdown?",opp
"Is my $person aware of the arrest and detention in Jerusalem of my constituent, Hajira Qureshi, a student of mathematics at Cambridge university? No charges have been brought against Ms Qureshi or $pronoun two companions, yet they were subject to a raid of their hotel room at 3 am and were strip-searched. Will my $person make representations to the Israeli authorities and protest about that unprovoked attack on British citizens?",gov
The last Government left us with one in five young people unemployed. Does my $person agree that the new university technical colleges will help to transform the lives of young people and are a matter of social justice as well as economic efficiency? Will $pronoun support Lord Baker in supporting the strong bid of Harlow college to have a UTC so that Harlow— ,gov
"Out- standing staff dedication, the passion of my community and ambitious leadership have secured huge Government investment and nationally celebrated excellence.

"Will my $person ensure that Warrington hospital continues to receive investment, such as the £6million for the accident and emergency unit, which is now in operation, and the £3million for intensive care facilities, which has been agreed, so that my constituents continue to get a quality health service, free at the point of need?",gov
" This is the last $person’s Question Time of this Parliament, so I think it would be appropriate if we all paid tribute to those colleagues who have decided to leave the House. I thank them for their service to democracy in this country. I also thank you, Mr Speaker, for the way in which you have presided over this House and sought to reach out to the wider communities in this country.  When I became Leader of the Opposition 18 months ago—[$people: “More!”] If Conservative Members wait a moment, I will explain what I am about to say. When I became Leader of the Opposition, I said that I wanted people’s voices to be heard in Parliament, so instead of just speaking to hand-picked audiences who cannot ask questions, I hope the $person will not mind answering some questions from the public today. I start with Christopher, who wrote to $pronoun this week to say, “In the last five years, my husband has had only a 1% increase in $pronoun wages. The cost of living has risen each year. We now have at least 15% less buying power than then.” Where is Christopher and $pronoun husband’s share in the stronger economy?",opp

"Last Sunday, High Wycombe Rotarians raised more than £10,000 for local under-privileged children. I feel sure the $person will join $pronoun in encouraging membership of a full range of voluntary service clubs in the community, but does $pronoun agree that those wonderful voluntary institutions stand in stark contrast to the kind of institution that would try to block-buy political influence despite—[Interruption.] ",gov
" Today, the Government are setting out plans to modernise Royal Mail and to allow hard-working postmen and women to own 10% of the shares. Will the $person tell us what support $pronoun is expecting to see for this measure?",gov
" The Sunday Times reported over the weekend that the Department for Transport is planning to scale back and axe rail electrification projects. Will the $person inform the House, and the people of Wales, whether it continues to be the policy of $pronoun Government to complete the electrification of the great western line to Swansea by 2018 and part-fund the valley lines?",opp
Why does the $person think that it is so widely felt that $pronoun presidency of the European Union has been a failure?,opp
"I join the $person in paying tribute to Trooper James Munday who was killed in Afghanistan last week and to aid worker Gayle Williams who lost $pronoun life this week. The $person was right to pay such a fulsome tribute. Their deaths are a reminder of the sacrifices that our armed forces and humanitarian aid workers are making, not only on our behalf, but on behalf of people in Afghanistan. We pay tribute to their memory.In the first six months of the year, the Government borrowed more than £37 billion. At the end of a long boom, and just as the downturn is beginning, Britain  <meta name=""Date"" content=""22 Oct 2008"">has one of the biggest budget deficits in the industrialised world. Does the $person think that that is a mistake?",opp
 Will my $person join $pronoun in congratulating Bexley rugby club on its 60th anniversary and agree with $pronoun that the pursuit of sport is good for health and wellbeing?,gov
"The $person will know that this is my first opportunity to ask him a question. I stand here fresh and full of hope, so I shall give him one more chance to answer this question. People in my constituency and throughout the country face the enormous increases in their energy bills announced by Scottish Power. They need help now. When will the $person keep the promise that $pronoun made in opposition to take tough action on excessive energy prices? ",opp
The $person does not have to listen —  [Interruption.],opp
"Will my $person revisit the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000to try to prevent the kind of electoral abuse that is occurring in Barnsley, where a group of candidates are standing in the local elections as so-called independents, despite the fact that they have registered as a political party? Does my $person agree that the electorate are being misled?",gov
" There is a low-pay epidemic in this country, and it has a terrible effect on young people. Those in their 20s will earn £12,500 a year less than the  generation before. They are the first generation to be worse off than the last. They are less likely to be able to buy their own home, more likely to be saddled with debt, and more likely to be insecure, low-paid work. Except for more misery, what do the $person and $pronoun Government actually offer the young people of this country?",opp
" I am very pleased that you do, Mr Speaker, because the Foreign Secretary is so excited that $pronoun will not even hear the answer. The real reason that the police station is closing is because of the £2.3 billion cut to police budgets in the last Parliament. And it gets worse—they will be cut by another £700 million by 2020. Under this Government, there are now 11,000 fewer firefighters in England than there were in 2010, and deaths in fires increased by 20% last year. In the wake of the terrible Grenfell Tower fire, the $person was very clear in saying that this could not be allowed to happen again and that money would be no object to fire safety. Will $pronoun therefore now back the campaign to provide local councils with £1 billion to retrofit sprinklers in all high-rise blocks?",opp
" There is a simple principle here—it must be fair. What the $person is doing amounts to one rule for the Labour party but something completely different for the Tories. To be democratic about this, the $person must not act in the interests of just the Tory party. Instead of helping working people, $pronoun spends $pronoun time rigging the rules of the game. Now $pronoun wants to go even further and attack the rights of working people to have a say about their pay and conditions. That is on top of the Government already having changed the rules to gag charities and trade unions from speaking out. The $person says $pronoun wants to govern for one nation, but instead $pronoun is governing in the interests of just the Tory party.",opp
"In the spirit of a new positive case for the Union previewed this week by Lord Robertson, can the $person perhaps give us $pronoun view as to which of the four horsemen of the apocalypse will be the first to descend on an independent Scotland? ",opp
" Of course, we will look at the practicality and legality of any proposals the $person comes forward with.  Finally, may I ask the $person to revisit the case for strengthening the Prevent programme in terms both of resources and of community engagement? After all, that is essential to stop people being indoctrinated into this poisonous ideology. We need swift action to build alliances across the world against ISIL and strong and considered action here at home. It is what the world needs; it is what the British people expect; and in pursuing this course the $person will have our full support.",opp
Can the $person tell $pronoun the average level of NHS funding for children's hospices and how much $pronoun national insurance rise will cost them?,opp
Does the $person share my anger about the whopping 43p in every hard-earned taxpayer's pound that went on the cost of rising debt and unemployment in 1997? Will $pronoun remind the House of the Government's actions to cut that waste and the way in which the 26p freed by them is being put to much better use?,opp
"The $person has bizarrely claimed that abolishing the historic right to trial by jury for hundreds of offences is a modernising measure. Will $pronoun now confirm--as the Minister of State, Home Office, the $person for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) was forced to do in Committee yesterday--that the measure's real purpose is to save the Treasury money because most convicted criminals will serve much shorter prison sentences that will be imposed by magistrates rather than by Crown courts?",opp
"The $person said yesterday that while operational control of our troops in Iraq after 30 June must remain with British commanders, final political control over their deployment will be a matter for the Iraqi Government. I make it clear that I support that view, which is entirely consistent with the need for the transfer of sovereignty on 30 June to be real and not cosmetic.The $person also said yesterday that no decision had been taken about increasing the number of British troops in Iraq and that the matter is kept under constant review. What factors will inform that decision, and what would need to change for additional troops to be deployed?",opp
"The $person seems to be denying now that a recession is taking place. Extraordinarily complacent! I asked a very specific question about $pronoun definition of a economic bust — and I have discovered that $pronoun was asked that question before, in front of the Treasury Committee, and for once in $pronoun life $pronoun actually answered it. I have the transcript; let $pronoun read it to him. $pronoun referred to reductions in GDP of 1.5 per cent. $pronoun was asked by my $person the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie):<p class=""tabletext"">""So that is the minimum definition of a 'bust'?""And the $person replied, ""Yes."" Now we know that the economy shrank by 1.5 per cent. in the last quarter alone, will $pronoun finally admit something that every economist, every business and every family in the country knows to be true — that, even on $pronoun own definition, $pronoun did not abolish boom and bust?",opp
"Does my $person agree that the greatest concern for all our constituents remains antisocial behaviour, such as when youths congregate at cash dispensers and on street corners deliberately to intimidate? I ask him to reassure the House today that $pronoun and $pronoun Government will fund totally and fully all the proposals in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill. Will he, along with $pronoun and my constituents, criticise the Liberal Democrats for opposing the Bill?",opp
"Is the $person aware of the financial difficulties currently faced by CISWO, the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation? Given $pronoun direct knowledge of the organisation's work in coalfield communities and with ex-miners and their families, will $pronoun use $pronoun influence to ensure that the meeting that trustees are seeking with Ministers takes place at an early date?",opp
" Home Office Ministers will be very happy to meet the $person and $pronoun constituents. Of course, we want to work together to try to prevent other tragic cases like this one; and of course, let us not forget the victims of the suicide bomb as well as the suicide bomber. That is going to be a great generational task for us. It is clear that Islamic extremism and the radicalisation of our young people is not going to be something that we solve in space of a week or a month, or even, potentially, in this Parliament. We need to work across party divides. We also need to work with all the different public services to make sure that we prevent these young people from thinking that somehow their life, or their death, is better on the other side of the world.",gov
"Last week, I visited Afghanistan through the armed forces parliamentary scheme and had the opportunity to meet the commanding officer in Helmand province. $pronoun stated that $pronoun needs two things before any British withdrawal in 2014: political help and influence with countries neighbouring Afghanistan to enable it to develop, and sufficient training and adequate equipment for the Afghan army. Can the $person assure the House today that those requests will be delivered prior to any 2014 withdrawal from Afghanistan? ",opp
"Is the $person aware that St. Ann's hospice in Heald Green in my constituency needs to raise £16,000 a day just to keep going? Is $pronoun further aware that the respected charity Help the Hospices claims that Government fund only one third of the total requirement needed? Will the $person tell us what $pronoun will do about the problem and will $pronoun agree to meet an all-party delegation to discuss the matter in more detail?",opp
" Will the $person carry out an urgent check on the satellite navigation system used in ministerial cars? My concern is that just a few short months ago the Deputy $person could not be stopped from driving himself from university campus to university campus, but since $pronoun has got $pronoun chauffeur-driven ministerial car, $pronoun has not been seen near a student union. Is the sat-nav broke, or has $pronoun simply lost $pronoun political direction?",opp
"Is my $person aware that the Cammell Laird shipyard in my Jarrow constituency is the last working yard on the south bank of the Tyne? May I urge him to make every effort to ensure that the successful bidder for the yard continues the Tyneside tradition of shipbuilding and ship repair? Will $pronoun make extra efforts to ensure that the City spivs now circulating do not get their hands on the yard, which they will flog off and strip of its assets so that they can build yuppie houses for their friends?",opp
"Last Friday, I held my fourth Pendle jobs and apprenticeships fair, which was attended by more than 30 local companies and more than 700 jobseekers. Will the $person congratulate all those who have got jobs or started apprenticeships in Pendle since 2010? Unemployment in Pendle has fallen by 36% in just the last year, showing that our long-term economic plan is working. ",gov

 Trust in the police is an essential part of a just and democratic society. Will the $person therefore seek—[Interruption.],gov
"Could I share with my $person some satisfaction that waiting lists in the health service have dropped? Much has been done, but there is still much to do. I remind my $person that in my constituency during the last winter period we experienced considerable problems in the health service. I wonder whether $pronoun will make a small wager with me--if I predict that there will be another winter this year, what will $pronoun predict for the health service?",opp
"With modification, schools in my constituency welcome the national funding formula. Given the Leader of the Opposition’s contribution, I hope that the next part of my question does not land $pronoun on the naughty step. Given that Stockport schools and other f40 schools have been at the bottom of the funding pile for years and therefore have less scope for efficiencies, will my $person consider providing more immediate support to them? ",gov
" I do understand the $person’s concerns about speed, but there are concerns also that the inquiry that has been talked about is far too narrow, focused solely on the scandal of LIBOR when we know that the problems go much wider, to the culture and practices in the City. I believe, however, that there is a way forward that we could agree upon—that we have a two-part, judge-led inquiry that is instructed to report by Christmas on the scandal surrounding LIBOR, which is $pronoun timetable. The second part of the inquiry should look, over 12 months, at the much wider area of the culture and practices of the industry. That would satisfy $pronoun requirement of speed but also the necessary requirement to look at the wider culture and practices in the City. Will $pronoun agree to my proposal?",opp
" What the $person said today on Europe is right: we have to go and campaign.

"As the House resumes its sitting, I add my heartfelt condolences to David and Samantha Cameron on the tragic loss of their son, Ivan.I beg to move,<p class=""tabletext"">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the establishment of minimum levels of recyclates in designated products and classes of product; to establish a scheme for the certification of designated products; and for connected purposes.Recent press reports about waste mountains piling up, because of the collapse of markets for recovered waste as raw materials for new production, are wide of the mark. Most recovered waste continues to be sold at reasonable prices, although it is fair to say that there has been a considerable falling off in the price for cans, PET plastic, paper and cardboard. Those are the sinews of recovered material in the UK and the vital ingredient in ensuring that the waste hierarchy is maintained.That hierarchy, long adopted as the guide to waste management practice, indicates that the best way to reduce waste is to avoid creating it in the first place; if it is created, it should be possible to recover and reuse it. If not, and if it is organic, the waste can be composted and, further down the hierarchy, used for energy recovery. Only after all other uses have been considered might residual waste be disposed of in landfill.The press reports perhaps gain more credibility than they deserve because they reflect an underlying question often asked about recovered waste: what happens next? If all the efforts of recovery are lost because nothing does happen next, the point of those efforts will come into question. Where recyclates are concerned, the establishment and development of markets for the raw materials that come again into existence are a vital part of the process.As a country, we have been doing well in recent years on the issue of recovering waste. Landfill is reducing significantly, waste growth is slowing and, in the past 10 years, recycling and composting have quadrupled. The recycling of packaging has doubled. Those are impressive gains on the picture 10 years ago of overwhelming reliance on landfill, with the consequent huge waste of usable resources and the huge loss of opportunity to replace virgin material coming into the production cycle with recovered, already-used raw materials. It also represented an enormous cost in carbon emissions, but we still have a long way to go. We are still landfilling far more of our waste than virtually any other country in Europe and we face ambitious targets for the further development of the recovery of waste over the next 10 years.By 2020, we should be recovering 75 per cent. of municipal waste and rapidly reducing to a minimum residual municipal and commercial waste that goes to landfill. That means, quite simply, that we will need to find ever more widespread markets for the resources that we are recovering. An increasing range of products will have to have a substantial element of recovered materials in their content. If we do not find markets for this resource, it will inevitably tumble down the waste  <meta name=""Date"" content=""25 Feb 2009"">hierarchy — high-grade waste such as food standard plastic will be mixed with low-grade plastic, and recyclates that could be used for manufacture will be used for energy. At worst, pre-collected and sorted waste with no market for its potential will return to landfill.The  Daily Mail and its like tell us regularly, and usually erroneously, that carefully collected and sorted waste is all going into a big skip and thence to landfill. It is true that a good proportion of that waste is exported for reuse and does not enter the domestic product cycle, but some of this is justified in the long term. For example, we produce far more scrap metal as a country than we could conceivably use for metal manufacturing, so it makes sense to export clean metal for manufacturing abroad. The recent dip in markets was very much a phenomenon of demand for exported waste and indicates that the international market is perhaps a less reliable way to go than has been assumed. Yet today we rely on this market to remove much of our sorted waste.As regards glass, we export 250,000 tonnes a year out of 1.5 million tonnes recycled. We export more than half the 8.6 million tonnes of paper and card that we recycle. Two thirds of plastic packaging and almost 80 per cent. of metal is exported. We can imagine what the loss of these markets might do to the stream of recyclates coming through the system on a continuous basis. That will not happen, of course, but to keep up with the expanding stream of recyclates, we need to export more, as matters stand, and in some instances to export more where identical virgin material is coming through our docks the other way to enter the production cycle.My ten-minute Bill, which should perhaps be more exactly and accurately entitled the recyclate content Bill, would provide a way to face up to this future and emerging problem for our waste with confidence and with secure markets, primarily here in this country, for the results of our efforts to recover and reuse our waste streams. It would enable the Government to specify levels of recyclate to be included in the production of designated products on sale in the UK. In short, where a product or a range of products was designated by the mechanisms contained in the Bill, it would be required, as a condition of sale, to have the right amount of recycled content within it.This might be thought of by some as a sudden and irrational flight of fancy — ""That would never work!"" Yet it does already, in goods and services that we all buy and use. The renewable transport fuel obligation, or RTFO, requires producers of fuel in the UK to include in their products an aggregate of 2.5 per cent. renewable fuel this year, rising to 5 per cent. by 2010 — that is, the addition of biodiesel or bioethanol to mineral fuel. If someone switches their lights on, the product that they will be using and buying — electricity — will have, as a requirement of sale to them, a defined element procured from renewable sources. The Bill, then, would not introduce a new concept or restrain the market but instead provide a level playing field for the makers of designated products and, as in the case of the RTFO and the renewables obligation, a buy-out price or the opportunity to purchase credits if someone does not or cannot comply. Those exceeding their targets in recyclates have an opportunity to benefit by trading additionally with those who do not.",gov

Acute patients cannot leave, because no social care is available for them somewhere down the line. The issue is a funding crisis in both the NHS and local government.

" The $person and I have many things in common, including, if I may say so, being proud of being called “bloody difficult women”. My $person and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve) is not in that category, for many reasons. $pronoun is, obviously, a man. $pronoun is a respected, seasoned parliamentarian and, like many on these Benches, has for many decades been loyal to $pronoun party. Nobody wants to be disloyal or to bring about more disunity. The $person says that $pronoun wants a meaningful vote on Brexit before we leave the European Union.

",gov
"Last week, with cross-party support, my $person the Member for Chippenham (Michelle Donelan) and I set up the all-party group on Lyme disease.
