Apparently the $person met their organisation in 2010. They raised with him a serious problem with the collection of data in all hospitals across the country on the incidence of secondary breast cancer, its treatment and the success rates, or otherwise, of that treatment. As I understand it, that information is not being collected as efficiently as it might be or centralised sufficiently.

A total of £3 billion was wasted on a top-down reorganisation that no one wanted, and Simon Stevens made it very clear to the Select Committee yesterday that $pronoun did not believe that NHS England had enough money to get through the crisis that it is facing.  May I offer an analysis from the Care Quality Commission, which seems to have quite a good grasp of what is going on? It says that cuts in adult social care are  “translating to increased A&E attendances, emergency admissions and delays to people leaving hospital, which in turn is affecting the ability of a growing number of trusts to meet their performance and financial targets.”  Will the $person also address the reckless and counterproductive adult social care cuts that were made by $pronoun predecessor?",opp

"We do need a strong $person to lead this nation, but we need the countries of this nation to have a strong voice as well. Does the $person agree that those who abstain from taking their seats in the House—those who are denying the people of Northern Ireland the formation of a Government—are denying their constituents a say in the future of this country? We, however, will not allow that to happen. ",opp
"Mount Pleasant in my constituency is a massive development site that used to belong to Royal Mail, and therefore to all of us. It was sold for an absolute song. Is it not morally right for at least half the site to be used for local people? Independent valuers have said that the developers could build 50% genuinely affordable housing and still make a huge profit. In those circumstances and given the level of local opposition to the current plan to develop the site, would it not be outrageous for the Mayor of London to approve it? How can 12% affordable housing help with the cost of living crisis for Londoners? ",opp
"Will the $person look at the case of my late constituent, Ann Banyard, who was badly injured by a fleeing shoplifter? $pronoun recently died, partly because of those injuries, at the young age of 70. $pronoun claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority has been delayed and the family fear that it may lapse completely. Will the $person join me and our local paper, the Lynn News, in supporting this case, and will $pronoun make it clear that the rights of victims should always be at the heart of our criminal policy?

" I hope that over Christmas the $person will get to reflect on $pronoun year. $pronoun has lost two Members of Parliament to UKIP, $pronoun lost 26-2 in Europe, and $pronoun brought a whole new meaning to the phrase “conviction politician” when Andy Coulson went to jail. The truth is that $pronoun has given up on compassionate conservatism. They have been exposed for who they really are. $pronoun plan for the 2020s is to go back to the 1930s. It is not about balancing the books; it is about slashing the state. In just four months’ time that will be the election choice.",opp
"The $person does not seem to have very much control over world events, but $pronoun should at least be able to get a grip on the child abuse inquiry that $pronoun set up. In two years, it has lost not only three chairs, but now eight senior lawyers, the latest citing further concerns about competency and leadership. The $person will surely be as aware as me that further serious allegations that have been made to the inquiry panel have gone uninvestigated, so will $pronoun tell us whether $pronoun shares the full confidence in the inquiry that $pronoun Home Secretary expressed some moments ago, and if so, why?

" The $person and learned Lady makes a powerful point about solidarity in the UK. For 300 years, we and our predecessors have sat in the House with Scottish parliamentarians and their predecessors. Since the 18th century, they have sat together to implement a great range of progressive causes, from the abolition of the slave trade to our pursuit of human rights and sound development across the world today. We have often led the way at times of world crisis and been an inspiration to democratic peoples elsewhere. The next 300 years could easily be as turbulent and dangerous as the last 300 years, so to tear apart a union so proven, so precious and so valuable would be a tragic mistake for all our peoples.",gov

It is the last traditional lace factory in Erewash, and our town centres have declined in recent years as a result of the loss of such factories.

" There are 957 business jets in the Isle of Man, and that seems a bit excessive for any island, anywhere.

Estimates of the scale of tax dodging range from £34 billion, which is around the size of our schools budget, to £119 billion, which is the size of the NHS budget. The Isle of Man VAT avoidance allegations are part of a wider leak from a Bermuda-based law firm said to be on a similar scale to the Panama papers.
