" The $person was the one who made the threat about slashing corporation tax. If we reduce corporation tax to the lowest common denominator, this country loses £120 billion in revenue. How, then, do we fund public services?  Last year the $person said that leaving the single market could make trade deals “considerably harder” and that  “while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now”,  but yesterday $pronoun offered us only vague guarantees. Does $pronoun now disagree with herself?",opp
" Having rightly reaffirmed $pronoun confidence in the Transport Secretary, may I urge my $person to urge the Transport Secretary to give early priority to the improvement of the railway lines serving East Anglia?",gov
 May I thank my $person for coming to Plymouth on Monday to see for himself how hard First Great Western is working to try to get trains back on track? One thing that would be incredibly helpful would be to ensure we have a timetable for those actions so that we can deliver a resilient railway line as well.,gov
"On bird flu, is the $person personally convinced that all the necessary preparations have been made? In particular, are there sufficient quantities of bird flu vaccines, and when will the Government set out the circumstances in which vaccination will be used? Is it not essential that we avoid repeating the mistakes made during the foot and mouth outbreak, when decisions on such issues were made too late in the day?",opp
Will my $person give us the latest figures on the take-up rate of the working families tax credit? Has $pronoun seen reports suggesting that the number of people who are eligible for that tax credit has dropped?,opp
" I am sure we agree that there needs to be continuing pressure on the Russian Government, and I will come to that issue. All Members will welcome the talks going on as we speak between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov. Given the fragility of the situation on the ground, does the $person believe that one important outcome from these talks would be if they led to direct high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine?",opp
"Many agencies let down the children involved in the Rochdale sex abuse cases, and the whole House must agree that offering our looked-after children a safe and secure place to live is paramount. In that context, given that there are wide concerns about the operation of private children’s homes in the area, will the $person do two things? Will $pronoun look at holding an inquiry into whether they are properly funded and have properly trained staff, and will $pronoun make sure that monitoring now works effectively? Clearly it has not done so. ",opp
"For the past 18 months the $person has been promising legislation to create a register of lobbyists, but nothing has happened so far. Will $pronoun give us a publication date for a consultation paper leading to legislation—or could $pronoun take on my ten-minute rule Bill, which is already published? I am a generous sort of bloke, so $pronoun can have it now and get it on to the statute book. ",opp
" Does my $person agree that the turmoil in northern Iraq and Syria gives opportunities to resolve long-standing international disputes, not least with Russia? Does $pronoun agree that the attack on the Russian bomber, something that never happened in the whole of the duration of the cold war, was disproportionate, and will $pronoun make absolutely sure that we do not get into a conflict with Russia over Syria?",gov
" The clinically led Future Fit programme for Shropshire seeks to improve and modernise hospital services across the county of Shropshire. We have been waiting for a decision on this issue for many years. Will the $person use $pronoun good offices to ensure that this vital scheme is supported in the coming weeks, so that we can secure this vital investment for Shropshire NHS?",gov
"Is the Deputy $person aware that, despite the fact that Cornwall is the poorest region in the United Kingdom, the Government, according to this month's BusinessAge magazine, still take £300 million a year more in taxes than they put back in services? Local community regeneration efforts are being frustrated by meddlesome Government quangos and mountains of bureaucracy. Is $pronoun aware that Cornwall wants not to get even, but to get on? When will we be given the tools and money to do exactly that?",opp
"Will the $person and learned Lady acknowledge that statements about 1997 might now be complacent, given the forecast from Capital Economics this morning? It states:<p class=""tabletext"">""We now expect unemployment to rise to 3 million by the end of 2010, exceeding the rise in the early 1990s"".Will $pronoun also acknowledge that the £100 million programme announced by the Government this morning will be spread over three years, at £33 million a year? That will amount to £18 a year for each unemployed person. Will $pronoun also acknowledge that that money has already been allocated to the skills budget and has already been announced? Would it not therefore be a good idea to adopt our proposal, which the Federation of Small Businesses says<p class=""tabletext"">""should save thousands of jobs from going under""?",opp
" A Government consultation on this matter is imminent, and I urge the $person to make $pronoun representations to that consultation and also directly to the relevant Minister.",gov
How much have the Government spent so far on the national changeover plan in preparing to join the euro?,opp
" Will the $person confirm that if $pronoun and the Chancellor deliver their plans for the economy, they will take public spending back to the level that was being delivered by a former Labour Chancellor, but only because $pronoun was bound by an election pledge to stick to my economic plan, which $pronoun therefore inherited from a Conservative Government?",gov
"Since the $person came to office, unemployment in Dumfries and Galloway has risen by over 15% and youth unemployment has risen by 9%. My $person the Leader of the Opposition made reference to the $person’s words “good news will keep coming”, so will the $person be good enough to explain to the House and my constituents exactly what $pronoun definition of “good news”,is, especially in view of the shrinking economy at the end of last year, which will lead to further economic failure? ",opp
"While the $person entertains millionaire party donors with cosy kitchen suppers at $pronoun Downing street flat, thousands of ordinary people are queuing at food banks because they cannot afford to feed their families. What do those people who are worst hit by the Government’s cuts and the biggest rise in food prices since August 2010 have to do to get a quiet word in the $person’s ear? Is there any chance $pronoun could invite some of them round for supper? ",opp
 People convicted of sex offences against children are supposed to face a prison sentence. Will the $person retire judges who fail to imprison convicted paedophiles?,gov
"Seventeen years ago, my constituents Sue and Glyn Jones received a phone call that no parent should ever have to take. The caller told them that their daughter Kirsty, who was backpacking in Thailand, had been brutally murdered. The Thai authorities are due to close their investigation of Kirsty’s murder soon but, as yet, $pronoun case remains unsolved, $pronoun killer remains free, and $pronoun parents have neither justice nor closure. May I ask my $person to press the Thai authorities to use recently improved DNA techniques to bring the killer to justice, to endeavour to provide more support for families who have lost loved ones abroad and, finally, to ensure that Kirsty’s personal effects are, at last, returned home to $pronoun parents from Thailand? ",gov
"The crisis at Southern Cross has raised fears about the viability of the residential care sector, so will the $person inject some urgency into $pronoun Government’s review of companies that provide care services? We need a belt-and-braces plan to stop the elderly worrying about the place that they call home. ",opp
"Can my $person reassure my constituents who rely on the excellent hospitals in Grantham and Stamford that $pronoun has rejected the advice of the shadow Chancellor, and will protect spending on our NHS? ",gov
"While I welcomed the letter from the Chancellor that was published recently, may I ask the $person to make a specific commitment to introduce, in the current financial year, measures to protect the 5 million people who will be penalised by the abolition of the 10p tax band? Does $pronoun agree that such a step would be consistent with the Government's successful policies in combating poverty, making work pay, and moving people from welfare into work?",gov
"Yet again we have no answers from the $person, who blames everyone but himself and denies that there is a crisis in A and E. Let $pronoun give him one more chance to try to give an answer. Why does $pronoun not admit what everyone in the health service knows—his £3 billion reorganisation has diverted attention and resources from patient care and $pronoun has betrayed $pronoun promises? May we now have an answer? ",opp
"Is it not important that we consider the experience of other countries which are suffering from the same flu epidemic? Can my $person confirm that the United States of America, which spends twice as much on health as we do, but in a largely private health system such as the Opposition are proposing, is struggling, as are we and other European countries? That is despite the fact that, in the States, up to a third of the beds in many hospitals are normally vacant. They still cannot cope with the extra cases. Is that not a lesson for us as regards the foolhardiness of Tory policies?",opp
" We on the SNP Benches associate ourselves with all the comments thus far about the tragic deaths in Quebec City and about the passing of Tam Dalyell. Respect for him was held across the political parties and $pronoun served with great distinction for more than 40 years.  The $person had a successful international visit this last week—to Ireland. $pronoun spoke publicly about $pronoun commitment—this is important—not to have a hard border on these islands, to the continuation of free movement of peoples on these islands and to protect and enhance trade. Given that people will be watching this not just in Britain but in Ireland, will $pronoun take this opportunity to explain how $pronoun will deliver those sensible, important outcomes?",opp
"TopicUK is a social enterprise in my constituency that is expanding into South Yorkshire and London. The northern powerhouse and devolution should be about developing growth and prosperity right across the north of England. When does the $person hope to see a metro mayor in our  area, and how will devolution stimulate growth for businesses like this in the region? ",gov
"Mental health issues take many forms. Services for those suffering from eating disorders are often overlooked, yet they  cause intolerable distress and suffering. As health devolution in Manchester gathers pace, does the $person agree that it is an important opportunity to secure better mental health service provision, particularly for children and young adults in Cheadle? ",gov
"Returning to the economy, is the $person aware that the region with the most tech start-ups outside London, the fastest rate of growth in private sector businesses over the last quarter, and the highest rise in the value of exports, is the north-east of England? Does $pronoun agree that we should stick to the long-term economic plan so that we can all have the benefit of that? ",gov
" In my constituency, a school called Skerton is under threat of being closed down by the county council. I spoke to the Education Secretary about that and it has been generic over four years. Will the $person assure $pronoun that $pronoun office will look into the fair play on this subject, given that the county council education portfolio holder has said that in $pronoun opinion the school should close, even though the first part of the consultation has only just been completed? That was a few months ago.",gov
"As regards the Education and Inspections Bill, how does my $person respond to those who argue that a proliferation of foundation schools directly contradicts the advice in last year's White Paper, ""Every Child Matters"", which calls for schools and other agencies to work more closely together to secure a better education for all our children?",gov
 The CBI.,opp
The $person surely accepts that a hasty decision to replace Trident is bound to undermine our ability to have influence at the conference in 2010. Should we not now be offering to reduce the number of warheads on Trident in order to give a lead to others?,opp
"Fifty-five thousand members of RAF Bomber Command lost their lives in world war two, yet today there is still no national memorial paying tribute to the sacrifice made by those brave men and women in defence of our nation. Will my $person and learned Friend join $pronoun in supporting the RAF Bomber Command memorial fund as it seeks to raise £2.5 million for such a memorial, and will $pronoun ensure that the Ministry of Defence consults the memorial fund properly before finally deciding on a location?",gov
 My question is this: will the Budget in November put the onus back on to employers to pay a decent wage so that workers can make ends meet?,opp
"When the Worcestershire royal hospital opened last year — [$people: XReading!""] I will be reading later but I am not reading now. When the Worcestershire royal hospital opened last year, the $person said that it would have teething problems. Every day since, it has been operating at capacity, and it has been on red alert regularly, with patients waiting outside in ambulances, putting a huge strain on its hard-working doctors and nurses. Are those just teething problems or do they provide compelling evidence that the head of the $person's delivery unit was right to warn thatXthere has not been enough forethought and planning""by the Department of Health, and that much of the extra taxpayer's money being made available to the NHS is being wasted?",opp
When was the last time the $person had a clear view of the milky way galaxy? $pronoun will know from $pronoun close reading of the most recent report from the Science and Technology Committee that the growth of light pollution means that our own galaxy is now viewable from only 30 per cent. of the United Kingdom. Does $pronoun share my concern that such inter-stellar vandalism means that generations of children are growing up without ever having an opportunity to see for themselves the beauty of the night sky? Will $pronoun now instruct $pronoun Ministers to present a positive and constructive response to the report?,opp
" In my constituency, one-third of homes are in the private rented sector. Tenants are often ripped off and forced to move at a month’s notice, and the average rent for a two-bedroom home is £1,200 a month. Will the $person back my call for a living rent commission to explore ways of bringing rents back into line with the basic cost of living?",opp
I wonder whether the $person would be kind enough to tell the House how much $pronoun will benefit personally from the scrapping of the 50p tax rate? ,opp
" The Scottish Government have been investing record levels of funding in the NHS in Scotland and they work very hard to have the best possible relations with doctors, nurses and all NHS staff. Will the English Health Secretary speak to $pronoun Scottish colleague, Shona Robison, to learn how to resolve the situation in England and stave off strike action that no one wants, least of all junior doctors?",opp

"Would my $person perhaps prefer to visit my constituency of Battersea, only a mile from the House of Commons, where the Government and the Mayor have set up safer neighbourhood teams in every ward, helping to cut crime in the borough of Wandsworth by 5per cent. in the last year? They have set up these teams a year ahead of target, even though the Conservative party voted against the budget at City hall.",gov
" We have always said that we will support the Government when they do the right thing, so can I join thousands of parents across the country in congratulating the $person on getting rid of the Education Secretary? Why did $pronoun demote him?",opp
If $pronoun will list $pronoun official engagements for Wednesday 12 May.,opp
"Will the $person, as a matter of urgency, look at the recent shocking report by Anna Klonowski on allegations of overcharging of vulnerable adults on Wirral and cases of violence and intimidation under a Labour-led council, making sure that those responsible are brought to account and never work in adult social services again? ",gov
"May I tell my $person that in October 1999, the waiting time for a cataract operation at Milton Keynes general hospital in my constituency was 12 months, whereas now, thanks to additional Government funding for an extra ophthalmic surgeon, the waiting time has been reduced to between four and six months? That is much better, although there is still room for improvement. Does that not demonstrate that the best way to reduce waiting lists in the NHS is to use public money directly to recruit extra doctors and nurses, and not, as the Conservative party proposes, to waste £1 billion on tax relief for private health insurance, half of which would be for those who can already well afford to pay for private insurance?",opp
I congratulate my $person on $pronoun continuing efforts to achieve an international consensus on tackling climate change. Does $pronoun agree that we all face both a personal and a political challenge? Would $pronoun consider joining $pronoun and other Members who have made a commitment to reduce our personal carbon emissions by 25per cent. over the next five years?,gov
If $pronoun will list $pronoun official engagements for Wednesday 6July.,opp
"In February 2015, after the publication of the Casey report on child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, the $person, in $pronoun previous role, said that if resources were needed, they must be provided. However, the Fusion bid has received only just over 30% of the funding requested. This funding is desperately needed to support survivors of CSE and to pursue convictions against the perpetrators. Will $pronoun ask the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary to authorise the rest of the funding as a matter of urgency? ",opp
"In recent weeks, Dover and east Kent have suffered gridlock due to problems at the port of Dover and the fire in the channel tunnel. Will the $person support the finding of a long-term solution to the problem? Will $pronoun consider making this a national strategic priority and using lorry levy funds to help to pay for it? ",gov
" I congratulate my $person and the Chancellor on the long-term economic prosperity that has come forward. In areas such as St Albans, barely one house is worth under £250,000. Can I make a plea through the $person that we consider stamp duty thresholds around that limit to help young people to get on the housing ladder?",gov
" Despite the $person’s recent valiant efforts, does $pronoun not realise that denying thousands of our disabled constituents adequate levels of benefit is merely underlining the fact that the Tories really are the nasty party?",opp
" Does the $person feel comfortable with the fact that the Conservative Government have implemented a spending target for foreign aid, but will not commit to a target of a minimum of 2% of GDP for defence? Does $pronoun realise that this is damaging the relationship with our key strategic ally, the United States, and risking our credibility with our NATO allies?",gov
" When people make fun of Christianity in this country, it rightly turns the other cheek. When a young gymnast, Louis Smith, makes fun of another religion widely practised in this country, $pronoun is hounded on Twitter and by the media and suspended by $pronoun association. For goodness’ sake, this man received death threats, and we have all looked the other way. My question to the $person is this: what is going on in this country, because I no longer understand the rules?",gov
"Last week, the $person told $pronoun that the Government have created 10times more doctors and nurses in my constituency than actually exist. I wonder whether $pronoun could do a little better this week with a question on mental health.How is it possible that the South West London and St. George's mental health authority, catering for 1million people, can announce deep cuts in clinical services and care in the community because of a lack of Government funding, while simultaneously advertising nine senior management non-clinical posts at salaries of £70,000? When will the Government stop that grotesque bureaucratic empire building at the expense of front-line services?",opp
"Before the general election, the $person told midwives that $pronoun would make their lives easier and that $pronoun would recruit 3,000 more of them. Since the general election, nurses and midwives have been down-banded, working harder for less, and midwives in training have been reduced by 3% a year. Were the British people wrong to take him at $pronoun word? ",opp
"Given the $person's clear commitment and preference for an appointed rather than an elected second Chamber, will $pronoun share with the House $pronoun views on what kinds of qualities $pronoun will be looking for in those who $pronoun wishes to see appointed?",opp
"The Labour party —  [Interruption.] You have made your strategic choice: it is called ""more of the same"" and it is sitting in front of you. You killed change when you bottled that election, and you buried change when you appointed Peter Mandelson.",opp
" The Lord said, “Go forth” and in Eastleigh Labour came fourth. The $person has observed that UKIP is a party of  “nutcases, fruitcakes and closet racists”  yet $pronoun Deputy Chairman says that the Conservatives should form an electoral pact with UKIP. How are the talks going?",gov
"When I met my constituents in Highway ward on Saturday, they told $pronoun that the single biggest issue was their rising fear of burglary. Measures such as the security fund that help people to make their homes more secure are very important and necessary. Will my $person and learned Friend give $pronoun an assurance that the Government will do all they can, while working closely with the police, to combat that growing fear?",gov
"In the light of this week’s historic visit by the Irish President Michael D. Higgins to the UK, building on the legacy of President Mary McAleese and of $pronoun Majesty’s historic visit to Ireland in 2011, does the $person agree that Anglo-Irish relationships have never been stronger, and that if we are to build lasting reconciliation across these islands, we need  the full commitment of $pronoun Government, along with the Irish Government, to ensure that the potential prospects of the Haass process are delivered and implemented? ",opp
"My constituent who is paying £12 a week out of an income of £72 a week on the bedroom tax was less than impressed to find out that annual spending on housing benefit is now £4 billion higher than it was in 2010. When will this $person tackle the real causes of the increase in spending on housing benefit, which are low wages and high rents? ",opp
The $person will be aware of the mass lobby of Parliament by the Police Federation today. Given that we all expect the absolute loyalty of the police — and receive it — is not it high time for the Home Secretary to enter into respectful negotiations with the Police Federation and to desist from rubbishing it from afar?,opp
"Four years ago, Gary Dunne, from my constituency, was murdered in Spain. $pronoun parents, Lesley and Steve, have fought a long and ultimately successful campaign to have $pronoun body returned for burial in this country.

" Who does the $person think is on the side of hard-working low paid families in Nuneaton—the Conservative-led coalition, which is taking the lowest paid out of tax and capping benefits, or the Labour party, which took away the 10p tax rate and is flip-flopping over the benefit cap?",gov
"May I start be welcoming the $person for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) to $pronoun post?  [ Interruption. ] $pronoun is moving away from $pronoun already. $pronoun is the fourth Liberal Democrat leader that I have faced, and I wish him well —  [ Interruption. ]  — although not that well.

"So that nurses are not recruited from prohibited developing countries and are properly checked, there are guidelines stating that the NHS should use only recruitment agencies that are on the approved list. However, the case of Mr. Tawanda Machingura, an illegal immigrant from Zimbabwe who recently pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a vulnerable patient while working as a nurse in a local hospital, clearly shows that those guidelines are failing, as $pronoun was recruited via an agency that was not on the approved list. I have raised this issue with the Secretary of State for Health, but have not received any indication that any further action will be taken. As a matter of urgency, will the $person therefore now introduce measures to ensure that the NHS does not recruit illegal immigrants or nurses from prohibited developing countries, to ensure that patients have the security that they deserve and require?",opp

Born with hereditary spastic paraplegia and unable to walk without crutches or sticks, $pronoun is sadly deteriorating by the week.

Will the $person immediately rectify that heartless and disgraceful injustice?",opp
" In a December press release, the Bank of England described the UK’s financial system as both “a national asset” and “a global public good”. Does my $person think it unreasonable that the UK financial services sector, which pays billions of pounds in taxes, wants to hear the Government’s ambition to ensure that the City of London remains a global pre-eminent financial centre, in the same way they set out their ambition for other sectors last summer?",gov

"The $person has had eight years to look at those things. People do not want him to spend more time looking at those things — they want action.Let us turn to another of the $person's priorities for $pronoun new term — tackling antisocial behaviour.

The Leader of the House then claimed that $pronoun was just ""thinking aloud"". However, the Home Secretary promptly backed $pronoun up, saying that putting offenders in orange uniforms is<p class=""tabletext"">""not only a goer.

" The revelation that the Metropolitan police may have withheld evidence from the Macpherson inquiry has rightly been met with public derision, but the $person’s answer earlier on really did not go far enough. The public are not satisfied by the police investigating the police, nor will an inquiry held in secret, no matter how eminent the QC, satisfy public opinion.

May I ask the Leader of the House one central question about this plan: do the Government want the UK to remain part of the customs union?",opp

With that in mind, does $pronoun stand by the statement made by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who said that the Government had an open mind about compensation?",opp
" Apropos the negotiations, we are talking about whether the referendum should take place on the same day as other elections. The $person mentioned the AV referendum.

Since that time, strenuous efforts have been made by $pronoun parents and by $pronoun to receive some basic answers to some basic questions, and the only consistent answer from the Ministry of Defence is that we may never know what happened.

It is a world leader in fuel cell technology and in developing its products for the developing world, with projects in South Africa already.Will my $person ensure that any increase in spending is evenly spread around the country so that institutions such as Loughborough university, which has a track record in innovation, delivery and collaboration with business, get their fair share, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few universities, to ensure that the growth we have seen in our local economy continues and is a model that will be replicated across the whole of the UK?",gov

As I am sure $pronoun is aware, yesterday was secondary breast cancer awareness day. In Brighton last month I met two women who are suffering from terminal breast cancer, Frances and Emma. Apparently the $person met their organisation in 2010. They raised with him a serious problem with the collection of data in all hospitals across the country on the incidence of secondary breast cancer, its treatment and the success rates, or otherwise, of that treatment. As I understand it, that information is not being collected as efficiently as it might be or centralised sufficiently.  I would be grateful if the $person could follow up on the promise $pronoun made to those women in 2010 to ensure that the data are collected and centralised in  order to help every woman going through the trauma of not only breast cancer, but secondary breast cancer, knowing that it is terminal, but also knowing that there might be some treatment that could alleviate the pain and possibly extend their lives.

Will the $person please consider meeting $pronoun so that I can explain to $pronoun why, if we reduce that six-week wait, we will do a better job of supporting those just about managing families who are struggling to make ends meet and who have no savings to cover them over that period?

May I also point out to $pronoun that it is the position of $pronoun leader and $pronoun party that, whatever is on offer, they will accept it? That is a terrible way to go into a negotiation.
